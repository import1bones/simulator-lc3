- Execution control (step, run, halt)

#### Instruction Set Implementation
- **Arithmetic**: ADD, AND, NOT (immediate and register modes)
- **Control Flow**: BR (all conditions), JMP, JSR/JSRR
- **Memory**: LD, LDR, LEA, ST, STR, LDI, STI

### ⚠️ **Areas Needing Attention**

#### Integration Tests (95% coverage, but failures)
**Issues identified**:
- Sample programs have incorrect PC-relative offsets
- Complex program execution gets stuck in infinite loops
- JSR/RET instruction pairing needs debugging

**Root causes**:
- PC-relative addressing calculation discrepancies
- Missing proper program counter handling in complex control flow
- Sample program encodings don't match expected memory layout

#### Memory Operations (95% coverage, failures in complex scenarios)
**Issues identified**:
- Negative offset addressing (2's complement calculation)
- PC-relative addressing base value
- Indirect addressing implementation

**Root causes**:
- Sign extension logic for negative offsets
- PC value timing (before vs after increment)
- Indirect memory access chain

### ❌ **Low Coverage Areas**

#### test_utils.py (29% coverage)
- Contains utility functions that are not fully exercised
- Many helper functions are tested indirectly
- Some edge case utilities are unused

## Instruction Implementation Status

### ✅ **Fully Working Instructions**
- **ADD**: Both immediate and register modes ✅
- **AND**: Both immediate and register modes ✅
- **NOT**: Bitwise complement ✅
- **BR**: All branch conditions (N, Z, P) ✅
- **JMP**: Jump to register ✅
- **TRAP**: HALT, OUT, GETC, PUTS ✅

### ⚠️ **Partially Working Instructions**
- **LD/ST**: Working for simple cases, issues with complex PC-relative ⚠️
- **LDI/STI**: Basic functionality works, indirect addressing issues ⚠️
- **LDR/STR**: Register mode works, negative offset issues ⚠️
- **LEA**: Basic load effective address works ✅
- **JSR/JSRR**: Calls work, return mechanism needs debugging ⚠️

## Performance Metrics

- **Test Execution Time**: ~0.2 seconds for full suite
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient (65K memory simulation)
- **Instruction Throughput**: >1000 instructions/second in tests

## Recommendations
