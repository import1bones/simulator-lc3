# Contributing to the LC-3 Simulator Project

Thank you for considering contributing to the LC-3 Simulator project! This document outlines the process and guidelines for contributing.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. Please be respectful, collaborative, and constructive in all interactions.

## Licensing

By contributing to this project, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's [MIT License](LICENSE). All new files should include the standard license header found in `LICENSE_HEADER.txt`.

## Development Process

### Setting up the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simulator-lc3.git
   cd simulator-lc3
   ```

2. Set up the development environment using the build system:

   ```bash
   ./build.py setup
   ```

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following the project's coding standards

3. Run tests to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality:

   ```bash
   ./build.py test --all
   ```

4. If you've added new functionality, add appropriate tests:

   ```bash
   ./build.py test --category your-new-category
   ```

### Documentation

- Update documentation to reflect your changes
- Add inline comments for complex code sections
- Follow the documentation guidelines in [docs/DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md](docs/DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md)

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update documentation as needed
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes
4. Wait for code review and address any feedback

## Testing

All contributions should include appropriate tests. See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for details on testing.

## Coding Standards

- Follow existing code style and formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write clear comments and documentation
- Add appropriate license headers to new files

## Continuous Integration

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration to automatically test and validate code changes. The CI workflow will:

1. Run when you push to main branches or create pull requests
2. Build the project on multiple platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS)
3. Run tests and generate coverage reports
4. Perform code quality checks

### CI Commands

You can run CI workflows locally using the build system:

```bash
# Run the default CI workflow
./build.py ci --workflow default

# Run the cross-platform CI workflow
./build.py ci --workflow cross-platform

# Run the nightly analysis workflow
./build.py ci --workflow nightly

# Run the benchmark workflow for performance analysis
./build.py ci --workflow benchmark

# Run a specific analysis script
./build.py run-script --script analysis/isa_design_analysis.py
```

### CI Workflow Structure

- **Default Workflow**: Basic build, test, and analysis
- **Cross-platform Workflow**: Tests on Linux, Windows, and macOS
- **Nightly Workflow**: Comprehensive analysis and performance benchmarking

For more details on CI setup, see [docs/ci/CI_WORKFLOW_UPDATE.md](docs/ci/CI_WORKFLOW_UPDATE.md).
