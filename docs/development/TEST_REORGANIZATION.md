# Test Structure Reorganization

## Summary of Changes

We have reorganized all test-related content to centralize it in the `tests` directory:

1. **Created a centralized test runner**:
   - Added `tests/test_runner.py` as the main test runner
   - Updated `build_system/test_commands.py` to delegate to this test runner

2. **Improved test environment setup**:
   - Created `tests/test_environment_setup.py` for environment verification and setup
   - Updated `tests/conftest.py` to use the new environment setup

3. **Added CLI Testing Framework**:
   - Created `tests/test_cli.py` for comprehensive CLI testing
   - Created fixtures for testing simulator CLI behavior
   - Documented the CLI testing approach in `docs/development/CLI_TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md`

4. **Updated documentation**:
   - Enhanced `tests/README.md` with information about the new test structure
   - Updated `build_system/README.md` to reference the new test organization

5. **Main build script updates**:
   - Updated `build.py` to use the proper import paths for build system modules
   - Removed unnecessary imports and updated module references

## Benefits

This reorganization provides several benefits:

1. **Better separation of concerns**:
   - Test content is now properly isolated in the tests directory
   - Build system focuses only on build operations

2. **Improved maintainability**:
   - Test-related changes can be made without affecting the build system
   - Test utilities are centralized and easier to find

3. **Cleaner dependency management**:
   - Clearer module import structure
   - Properly organized Python modules

4. **Enhanced documentation**:
   - Better documented test architecture
   - Clearer instructions for running tests
